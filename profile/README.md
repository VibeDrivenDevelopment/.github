# Vibe Driven Development

ü™¶ Here lies VibeDrivenDevelopment ‚ö∞Ô∏è

An organization focused on building cool things with their friends. Then one day, the AI grifters showed up and drastically changed the definition of 'Vibe' coding (auto-complete go brrrrrrr). So for now, we've moved on. I retain this name to ensure that no new ~~grifts~~, ~~ponzi schemes~~, totally legitimate business models gobble up our good name.
